Charged particles are accelerated in an electric
field due to the Coulomb interaction. When the
polarity of the electric field is periodically altered,
so will the direction of the force. One specific
geometry is a quadrupolar ion trap, also called
Paul trap, where the shape of the electric field of a
quadrupol combined with a periodic field reversal
in the radio frequency range (RF) is used to keep a
charged ion in a fixed position. Knowing the position of individual ions is one of the key requirements for direct experimental studies on quantum systems and consequently the importance of
designing a system keeping individual atoms and ions in a known position was awarded
the Nobel prize in 1989. The motion of the ion within the trap is governed by a second
order differential equation. As there are three dimensions, in reality one has to solve 3 of
those. For this project we consider only a simplified one dimensional system with position x.
